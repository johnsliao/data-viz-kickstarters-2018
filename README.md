## Project Specifications
### Picking the Data Set 
Look into the following sites as an example and select a data set that interests you. 

1.	https://www.kaggle.com/datasets 
2.	http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html 
3.	Any other source of your choice 

### Preparing the data 
- Import the data set into R. 
- Document the steps for the import process and any preprocessing had to be done prior to or after the import. Any R code used in the process should be included. 
Analyzing the data 
- Do the analysis as in Module 3 for at least one categorical variable and at least one numerical variable. Show appropriate plots for your data. 
- Do the analysis as in Module 3 for at least one set of two or more variables. Show appropriate plots for your data. 
- Pick one variable with numerical data and examine the distribution of the data. 
- Draw various random samples of the data and show the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem for this variable. 
- Show how various sampling methods can be used on your data. What are your conclusions if these samples are used instead of the whole dataset. 

### Presenting the Project 
- You need to record your project presentation and submit it as well. 
- Each presentation is for at most 10 minutes. 
- The project will be due on Sunday, December 16th, 11:59 PM EST.
